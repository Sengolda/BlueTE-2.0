### About BlueTE 2.0
* BlueTE 2.0, is a well developed and maintained discord bot project generator with support for javascript and python (discord.js and discord.py).

### Getting Started
BlueTE is an **NPM** package available for anyone to download, follow these steps to get it up and running.
if you don't already have node and npm, you can get them by [clicking this link](https://nodejs.org/en)

- Installing BlueTE 
   - You can install **BlueTE** by doing `npm i -g BlueTE`.
   - But this does not sometimes work on MacOS, to fix this you can try `sudo npm i -g BlueTE`
   - Also NOTE that `-g` is required, cause BlueTE needs to be global in order for it to work properly.

- Ok Now it is time to generate your bot project.
   - To generate your bot project just run `bluete` in your command-line.
